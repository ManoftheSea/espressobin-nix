# NixOS on the Marvell ESPRESSObin
http://espressobin.net/

# U-Boot
Build with `nix-build -A pkgsCross.aarch64-multiplatform.ubootEspressobinImages`.

The bootloader image produced by this repo is currently only for ESPRESSObin V7 1GB!

The reason for this is that different boards have different memory layouts, and the memory layout is current hardcoded to the V7 1GB board.

## Extra steps after flashing
1. Load default U-Boot environment with `env default -a`.

## Boot the generic aarch64 image
1. Add `console=ttyMV0,115200n8` to the kernel command line.

## TODO
- Fix MAC addresses not being passed to Linux.

## Hardware notes
- The V7 schematics (page 9) imply you can boot U-Boot from SD card by setting the three mode jumpers to 1. The [wiki page](http://wiki.espressobin.net/tiki-index.php?page=Ports+and+Interfaces) table seems to be wrong, all modes except SPI NOR flash are the same.
